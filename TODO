TODO 10th May:
- Add XGBoost to the evaluation for all runs x 3 - DONE
- Select best run from macro_avg + loss functions x 3 - DONE FOR 2
- Run with the best runs x 3 - DONE FOR 2
- Run CTGAN with a condition to "oversample" the bruteforce and pingscan and then evaluation
- Run CTGAN where all the attack types are equally distributed
- Label as target value - binary classification on all three final models
- CTGAN with Label target value equally distributed
- Add cross validation with attack type as the split and 5 folds and the label as target value where it is binary - normal or attacker


Experiments total:
- HPO run for all three 
- Best run for all three
- CTGAN with no condition
- CTGAN with condition - oversample the underrepresented classes
- CTGAN with condition - equal distribution of all classes
- Add cross validation with attack type as the split and 5 folds and the label as target value where it is binary - normal or attacker
- Label as target value - binary classification on all three final models
- CTGAN with Label target value equally distributed
- Compare training time for all 3
- Compare sampling time for all 3
- Add UniformSynthesizer as baseline

- Meeting:
- Tell them cross validation is not feasible on itgan
- Ask :
    1. Related Work -> General papers, and then our 3 models 
        or
    2. Related Work -> General papers AND then Models -> Going deeper into our 3 models
