TODO 10th May:
- Add XGBoost to the evaluation for all runs x 3
- Select best run from macro_avg + loss functions x 3
- Run with the best runs x 3
- Run CTGAN with a condition to "oversample" the bruteforce and pingscan and then evaluation
- Run CTGAN where all the attack types are equally distributed
- Label as target value - binary classification on all three final models
- CTGAN with Label target value equally distributed
- Add cross validation??


Experiments total:
- HPO run for all three 
- Best run for all three
- CTGAN with no condition
- CTGAN with condition - oversample the underrepresented classes
- CTGAN with condition - equal distribution of all classes
- Label as target value - binary classification on all three final models
- CTGAN with Label target value equally distributed
- Add cross validation??
- Compare training time for all 3
- Compare sampling time for all 3
