Total Experiments:
- HPO run for all three (CTGAN 20 runs, CTAB 10, ITGAN 10) - DONE
- Best model run of all three - DONE
- CTGAN no condition - DONE
- CTGAN with equally distributed attack type - DONE
- CTGAN with oversampling the underrepresented classes - DONE
- CTGAN with Label target value equally distributed - DONE
- CTGAN and CTABGAN Cross Validation on where split on attack_type but binary classification on label - normal or attacker and then average the results
- No Cross validation, run the best model for binary classification - all 3
- Identity and UniformSynthesizer as baseline + Compare classification metrics for all 3 - DONE
- Compare training time for all 3 - DONE
- Compare sampling time for all 3 - DONE
- Adversarial Validation for all 3 - attack_type and label


To do:
- Rerun the utility metrics for ctabgan model
- ITGAN Binary
- CTAB Binary
- CTAB CV
- Adversarial Validation
