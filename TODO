- Move data cleaning pynb to python file:
    - sample the data 
## DONE

- Know the data formats of all 3 models (input/output)
    - test input output
## TGAN has OOM issues
## TableGAN preprocess issues
    - write data adapters for each model
- Integrate wandb
- Have a cli and sh file for all 3
- use wandb/hydra to log cli inputs and possibly do hyperparametertuning
- write model outputs to a common data format
- (clean data), get the outputs and then run evaluations in some notebook


TODO for the data:
- use data first without the date column and see how the results are 
- check results with date column (specifically CTGAN)
